<li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
<li>Make the chicken rolls: Place each chicken breast half between sheets of plastic wrap and pound with a meat mallet 
    <br>to about 1/8 inch thickness. Place a piece of cheese on each ham slice and sprinkle lightly with thyme and salt and pepper to taste. 
    Roll up seasoned ham and cheese jellyroll-style, then roll each chicken breast with ham and cheese inside. Tuck in ends and fasten with toothpicks.</li>
<li>Place melted butter in a small bowl and place cereal crumbs in a shallow dish or bowl. 
    <br>Dip each chicken roll in butter, then roll in crumbs, turning to coat thoroughly. Place coated rolls in the prepared baking dish.</li>
<li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken is golden brown and juices run clear, about 40 minutes.</li>
<li>While the chicken is cooking, prepare the cordon bleu sauce: Mix together condensed soup, sour cream, and lemon juice in a small saucepan.
    <br>Heat over low heat, stirring occasionally, until combined. Serve hot over chicken rolls.</li>
