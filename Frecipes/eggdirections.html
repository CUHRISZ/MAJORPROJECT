<li>Beat eggs thoroughly in a bowl; whisk in dashi stock, sugar, mirin, and soy sauce until sugar has dissolved.
<br><br>Lightly grease a nonstick skillet and heat over medium heat.</li>
<br>
<li>Pour a thin layer of egg mixture into the hot pan and swirl to coat the pan. 
    <br>Cook until egg layer is firm on the bottom but still slightly liquid on top, about 1 minute. 
    <br>Then lift up one edge using a spatula and roll up the egg layer. Push omelet roll to one side of the skillet.
    <br>
    <br>Oil the skillet again and pour in another thin layer of egg, lifting the first omelet roll up slightly to allow 
    <br>the egg to flow underneath; roll up the first omelet in the new layer of egg and push omelet to the edge of the skillet as before. 
    <br>Repeat the process with the remaining egg mixture, oiling the pan each time if needed.
  
<br><li>Remove rolled omelet to a serving platter and cut into 6 equal pieces to serve.</li>
